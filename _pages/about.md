Hi! Iâ€™m Jerry Jin, a research associate in the Machine Learning Department at **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**. I hold an M.A. in Statistics from **UC Berkeley**, as well as a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Philosophy from **Peking University (PKU)**.

My general research interests lie in **Computational Cognitive Neuroscience** and computational approaches in Psychology. At PKU, I've had the priviledge of working with [Prof. Huihui Zhang](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/en/info/1408/2098.htm) and [Prof. Huan Luo](https://mgv.pku.edu.cn/english/people/lbd/sopacs/360652.htm) on serial dependence. I also had a wonderful experience collaborating with [Prof. Michael Kahana](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/michael-kahana) in [CML Lab](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page) at UPenn, where we developed CMR-IA, a model of memory for items and associations. 

Currently, I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/), focusing on the integration of machine learning with MEG and fMRI in naturalistic experiments.
