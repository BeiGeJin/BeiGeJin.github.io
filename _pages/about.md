Hi! I’m Jerry Jin, a Master's student at Department of Statistics, U.C. Berkeley. I also have a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Philosophy at PKU (Peking University).

My general research interest lies in computational modeling in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. I'm especially interested in the research of <i>memory</i>, which, I think, is essential to our understanding of who we are.

I had the priviledge of working with [Prof. Huan Luo](https://mgv.pku.edu.cn/english/people/lbd/sopacs/360652.htm) and Huihui Zhang on serial dependence at PKU. I also had a wonderful time working with [Prof. Michael Kahana](https://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/people/michael-kahana) in [CML Lab](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page) at UPenn on CMR-IA, a model of memory for items and associations. Currently, I'm working on developing rucurrent neural networks coupled with feedback control in [NSDS Lab](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/) at U.C. Berkeley, guided by [Prof. Kristofer Bouchard](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/kristofer-e-bouchard/).

I’m seeking 2024 Fall RA position in labs focusing on psychology/cognitive neuroscience.
