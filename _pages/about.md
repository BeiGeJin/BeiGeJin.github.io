Hi! I’m Jerry Jin, a Master's student at Department of Statistics, U.C. Berkeley. I also have a B.S. in Psychology and a B.A. in Philosophy at PKU (Peking University).

My general research interest lies in computational modeling in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. I'm especially interested in the research of memory, which, I think, is closely related to our understanding of consciousness and self.

I had the priviledge of working with Professor Huan Luo and Huihui Zhang on serial dependence at PKU. I also had a wonderful time working with Professor Michael J. Kahana at UPenn on CMR-IA, a model of memory for items and associations. Currently, I'm working on developing rucurrent neural networks coupled with feedback control in NSDS lab at U.C. Berkeley, guided by Professor Kristofer Bouchard.

I’m seeking 2024 Fall RA position in labs focusing on psychology/cognitive neuroscience.
