I investigated the attractive bias in perception and decision caused by previous experience, i.e., serial dependence. I conducted four behavioral experiments with novel paradigms and self-written programs in MATLAB and JavaScript. I analyzed the experiment data from a temporal perspective and revealed a build-down in serial dependence and visual adaptation throughout the experimental session, which was neglected by most previous studies.
