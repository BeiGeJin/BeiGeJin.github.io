We developed the Context-Maintenance and Retrieval model for Items and Associations (CMR-IA), a computational model of memory based on previous CMR models. We implemented the model in Python, performed simulation on eight classic experimental paradigms and two new experiments, thus accounted for several benchmark phenomena concerning recognition and cued recall including recency effects, similarity effects, contiguity effects, word frequency effects, and associative symmetry. We offered a unified theoretical framework for memory of items and associations.
