We developed digital twins for Alzheimer’s Disease patients, i.e., predictions of outcomes for individual patients describing their likely progression in the future under standard-of-care given their baseline characteristics. We exploited the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and extracted features including psychological assessments, biospecimen, genetics, and PET imaging. We trained a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine in Python to perform the prediction and evaluated it against baseline models including ridge regression and random forest.
